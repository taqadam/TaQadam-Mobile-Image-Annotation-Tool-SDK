## Install Android Studio
The recommended way to develop applications for Android is by using Android Studio, which can be downloaded [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html)

## Open the project with Android Studio
Launch Android Studio and choose **Open an existing Android Studio project**
In the file selector, choose `Unicef-sdk-taqadam`.
You will get a **Gradle Sync** popup, the first time you open the project, asking about using gradle wrapper. Click **OK**.

## Set up an Android device
You can't load the app from android studio onto your phone unless you activate **developer mode** and **USB Debugging**. This is a one time setup process.

Follow these [instructions](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options.html#enable).

## Run the app
In Android Studio run a **Gradle sync** so the build system can find your files.

Then hit play to start the build and install process.
